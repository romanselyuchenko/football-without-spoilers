# FOOTBALL MATCHES WITHOUT SPOILERS
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/zBZWUWyCg8M>
#### Description:

This is my final project for "Harvard CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python". For football fans, there often comes a time when there are just too many matches to keep track of, and you just want to find out if there are any interesting games today without any spoilers.

This program allows exactly that: it shows matches from top leagues and displays whether the match is over or how much longer it will last.

You are free to select the leagues and choose how you want the output displayed.
#### How to use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the app directory.
3. Run code `python project.py`

#### Examples
```
League: La Liga (Spain)
Sevilla - Finished - Real Betis
Date: 2024-10-06
----------------------------------------
League: La Liga (Spain)
Real Sociedad - Finished - Atletico Madrid
Date: 2024-10-06
----------------------------------------
```
Or if there is no matches
```
"No matches found for the selected leagues today."
```
